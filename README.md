This website is a self‑hosted passion project that I design, build, and maintain end‑to‑end. The stack is 100 % infrastructure‑as‑code: Terraform provisions the AWS backbone, a GitHub Actions pipeline builds Docker images and ships them to ECR, and Helm deploys the Kubernetes workloads (NGINX web tier, Kafka stream, Postgres, micro‑services). Everything you see—from the LEGO‑themed UI to the real‑time earthquake dashboard—runs on clusters I manage myself, proving out production DevOps patterns in a fun, personal sandbox.

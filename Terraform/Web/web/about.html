      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>
        <p>I grew up in rural Colorado after moving from San Diego at age six. With open spaces and endless freedom to tinker, I naturally gravitated toward building and problem-solving from an early age. Whether I was constructing treehouses, disassembling electronics, or piecing together my first computer, I was always driven by curiosity and the satisfaction of figuring things out.</p>
        <p>I studied Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs with the original intent of becoming an actuary. But the pull of the tech world—fast-moving, creative, and constantly evolving—proved stronger. What began as a fascination with systems and code quickly turned into a full-blown career, one that has taken me through the evolution from mainframes to data centers and now to the cloud.</p>
        <p>After college, I moved to Denver and have called it home ever since. Along the way, I've developed a reputation as a jack of many trades with a hunger to learn. I love a good challenge, especially when it requires learning something entirely new on the fly—whether that’s brewing beer, renovating my house, or rebuilding a car engine. I’ve found that staying ahead in tech means always being a student, and that suits me perfectly. I’m endlessly curious, resourceful, and happiest when I’m deep in a DIY project or solving a tough problem.</p>

      <h2>VJ - Live Visual Performer </h2>
      <p>
        Since 2016, I've pursued VJing as a passion project that blends art, code, and technology. I create live visuals that combine real footage, generative content, and 3D rendering—often using AI and custom programming to drive interactive or reactive elements. My work frequently involves collaborating with musicians and artists, syncing visuals to sound and performance in real time using multiple live input sources. It’s an evolving creative outlet where I merge storytelling, technical experimentation, and visual design.
        Check out the video below for a glimpse into one of my live performances.
